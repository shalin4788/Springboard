## About 
The data you need is in the "country_club" database. This database
contains 3 tables:

i) the "Bookings" table

ii) the "Facilities" table, and

iii) the "Members" table.

In this case study, you'll use tools such as 

- MySQL or PHPMyAdmin

- Juptyer Notebook

- SQLite (Just as export database to SQLite format using Python library)

to tackle a series of challenges on a database containing information about 
a country club. For this case study, you'll see what a database looks like on a nice interface like PHPMyAdmin, and connect to a local instance of the database 
using Python and SQLite
