# Description

**Problem**
An existential problem for any major website today is how to handle toxic and divisive content. Quora wants to tackle this problem head-on to keep their platform a place where users can feel safe sharing their knowledge with the world.

**Tasks**
-	Develop scalable methods to detect toxic and misleading content like:
o	Non neutral tone
o	Disparaging tone
o	False information
o	Absurd assumptions
o	Sexual content
-	Weed out insincere questions -- those founded upon false premises, or that intend to make a statement rather than look for helpful answers.

**Data used**
Data files contain
-	Training and testing data set where training data set contains quora questionIdâ€™s with insincere content marked by value = 1, otherwise 0
-	Number of word embeddings along with the dataset that can be used in the models
The file is a matrix of about 376 thousand observations and 7 variables.
